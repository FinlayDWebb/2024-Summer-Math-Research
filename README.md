#progress log

-------------------------------------------------------------

Pre 19th May – 
Allanah Neff (PhD candidate at Uni of Edinburgh) and I had a few zoom meetings to discuss a general direction for the summer research, proposals included PDEs with relation to fluid mechanics, as well as DEs with relation to cell membranes, this was something that really interested me. Allanah’s supervisor had previously done a thesis on a similar thing, however hers was very much theoretical as it didn’t utilise experiment-gathered data. This data is now accessible, and the general idea was to create a particular differential equation to model the movement of ions (potassium) through a cell membrane, with interest in voltage too. To explore this Allanah sent me some notes from a module at her masters at Oxford, titled Mathematical Physiology, for me to better understand the idea we were talking about. Up to this point, the specific project is uncertain, but we have a general direction, and planned to meet tomorrow on the 20th May.

Main takeaways:
1. The project will be in the area of Applied Maths within Biology/Physiology, utilising an data set from an experiment.
2. Prepare directional questions for the meeting on the 20th May
3. Keep on top of UKMT summer school commitments (seperate project)

21st May -
The meeting was moved to today at 10AM, so to prepare for the meeting I made notes on all of the topics I was unsure on, notably mass-action kinematics, along with some partial differential equations describing the flux of ions through a cell membrane. The meeting was about general understanding, and to correct the direction of my reading. My supervisor (Allanah) gave me a new book to read, Mathematical Physiology II by Sneyder, and told me to grasp an understanding of mass-action kinematics too. The next meeting is on Friday the 24th May, to discuss my findings and point to forward work; as she is away the following week. The research is looking like it'll be into refining a model that her supervisor (Dr Mariia Dvoriashyna) researched/created for a publication a few years ago. I have a better grasp of the general topic idea now from my reading, and hope to be even more confident talking about the idea with my supervisor at the end of this week.

Main takeaways:
1. Read into 'Mathematical Physiology by Sneyd'
2. Research Mass-action kinematics

28th May -
Allanah has a research trip this week so I am delving deeper into the reading and having a go at the questions. The real issue at the minute is the notation. A lot of the topics aren't too alien, except some complex differential equations, but the notation since it is a different discipline of Mathematics is proving hard. Having made notes on the relevant chapter of Mathematical Physiology I know that I need to go back over them, and perhaps subsitute other mediums of learning, like articles, videos, lectures to supplement my learning. Mass-action kinematics were simpler than I thought, it was just a rule outlining when you can use the form of differential equation in reaction schemes, and when you can't (when the process is complex and has multiple different steps and stages). I am looking to be able to tackle atleast one question from the exercises section in the chapter before my meeting with Allanah next week (3rd June- 10th June), this is looking very difficult but I am keen to try. I will update this README accordingly.

Main takeaways:
1. The reading is going well so far, but I need other mediums of learning to supplement the process (lectures, articles).
2. Try and tackle one question from the exercises in the Chapter of Sneyd's book.
3. Be prepared to have a productive meeting with Allanah next week where we can take a big step forward.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Friday 14th June - 
It's been a while since I updated the log, this is due to there only being one meeting since the previous log, and also both Allanah and I had other things going on. Since the last log, I successfully carried out steps 1, 2 and 3 from the Main takeaways. Moving on, the most recent meeting we went over the equations that Sneyd uses in the book to derive certain characteristics and create specific plots for the pump-leak model, which is what we are looking at right now. The pump-leak model is effectively a process by which a cell uses both active and passive transport in controlling its volume as well as its charge and ion population. When we went over these equations two things were apparent. 

Problem:

1. I didn't yet know enough around the subject to fluently communicate my thoughts, this needs to change.
2. I also need to make notes on what each component of the function means and relates to, i.e. where it comes from.
  
So coming away from the meeting I knew I had to act on these two things. Allanah also instructed me to find some 'motivation' for why we should care about controlling the volume of a cell, or what ions come in and out of the membrane; as this is important in writing up a full publication. So we move to the main takeaways:

Main takeaways (solutions to the problem):
1. Take a step back and try and see/understand the larger picture here, I need to really explore the topic in its entirety, not this one model in isolation.
2. Try and find some motivation/real-world reasoning for why we should care about this model, or functions of the cells themselves.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Sunday 16th June -
I've made some progress since the last log, successfully finding where every component came from within the equations that Sneyd lays out to be vital for solving a model of the pump-leak model. This includes an equation that states the rate of change of concentration of an ion equals the volume of passive transport plus active transport (it's not as simple as that), which makes perfect sense. Stepping back helped me understand this whole model that Sneyd explores much more clearly. Including learning about the Gibbs free energy equation, the Nernst equation, and the relationship between membrane equilibrium and chemical potential. On the motivation side of things, I have found some points as to why we should care about the regulation of cell volume, this includes facilitating osmosening in the hypothalamus (this triggers the feeling of thirst), as well as being inherently linked to cancer growth. I haven't yet finished my docx on motivation, I hope to have this done before Tuesday, giving me time to recap my new notes, and find something else to bring to the next meeting. The whole process is becoming more clear now.

Main takeaways:
1. Continue to develop the docx that lays out the motivation for the research, and here specifically the pump-leak model. Before Tuesday
2. Recap and read further before the next meeting, as to continute the momentum of progress.
