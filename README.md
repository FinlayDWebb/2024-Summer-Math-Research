# 2024-Summer-Math-Research
Specifics to come.

#progress log

Pre 19th May – 
Allanah Neff (PhD candidate at Uni of Edinburgh) and I had a few zoom meetings to discuss a general direction for the summer research, proposals included PDEs with relation to fluid mechanics, as well as DEs with relation to cell membranes, this was something that really interested me. Allanah’s supervisor had previously done a thesis on a similar thing, however hers was very much theoretical as it didn’t utilise experiment-gathered data. This data is now accessible, and the general idea was to create a particular differential equation to model the movement of ions (potassium) through a cell membrane, with interest in voltage too. To explore this Allanah sent me some notes from a module at her masters at Oxford, titled Mathematical Physiology, for me to better understand the idea we were talking about. Up to this point, the specific project is uncertain, but we have a general direction, and planned to meet tomorrow on the 20th May.

Main takeaway:
1. The project will be in the area of Applied Maths within Biology/Physiology, utilising an data set from an experiment.
2. Prepare directional questions for the meeting on the 20th May
3. Keep on top of UKMT summer school commitments (seperate project)
